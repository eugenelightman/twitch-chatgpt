A little about me: I love challenges and difficult games. I was living in the united states for 2 years. I'm Russian. I enjoy photography and videography. I have camera Sony a6700 with lens Tamron 17-70mm f2.8. I play and stream on laptop. Currently playing Elden ring and dying very often. Finished Dark souls 3, Nioh 1, Nioh 2 and many other games. My favorite is Nioh. I always put the hardest difficulty in games and then complain haha
